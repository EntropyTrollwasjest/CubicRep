3d Printer - Land of Stuff


First - I'm not a 3d printer Expert
Second - Others have done insanely useful works in the field of 3d printers.
Third - The spirit of RepRap and the fun of 3d printing is to build and advance the machine designs.


Goals:
1. Define the requirements to aid in component selection
2. Develop BOM based on requirements
3. Document assembly process
4. Document tuning and "dialing in" process
5. Share design and solicit feedback for improvement


My history with 3d Printers and what started this project:
I built a Reprap Mendel and then got away from 3d printers for a while. 

About a year ago I ended up buying a box of ender 3 returned parts. I built up the ender3 and upgraded as far as it seemed reasonable. Replacing the bed, adding an all metal hotend, and a spring steel print surface. With a dollar tree foam board enclosure it was printing ABS. It was time to upgrade again. The problem was the $150 printer, had about $300 worth of upgrades already. If I add a raspberry pi, a new controller, new motion components....why not look at other printers.

Ultilmaker S5 - 13x9x11 - enclosable - duel extrusion ~$6,000
Ultimaker S2 - 9x9x8 - enclosable - single extruder - $2600
LulzBot Taz - 11x11x11 - open - single extruder - #3,995
Raise3d E2 - 11x9x9 - enclosed - Duel Extruder - $3,499
Fusion F410 - 14x14x12 - enclosed - single extruder - $5250

So >$3k for a commercial off the shelf printer

What about the exisiting communities around popular DIY designs?
RepRap
Voron
Hevort
BLV Cube
RailCore
Hypercube

This is only my opionion and only based on what I have seen:
RepRap - is a shell of community as compared to when I built a Mendel. The Prusa line has done great things to advance this line, but the real creativity and advancedment now seems to be locked behind what Prusa can pull off as economically viable.


My Requirements:
Enclosure - not necessarily structurally imporant but easy to impliment for ABS components.
12"^3 or 300mm^3 build volume
PC capable 3d printer - stable bed and enclosure temps elevated from bed, but not a true high temp machine capable of PEEK (maybe in the future)
Control via klipper with either octoprint or mainsail
Exclusion of grey market components for safety and to help further 3d printer and related activities
<$3k ideal but not required
